# Twitch Channel Points Redeem
This is based on Python Selenium module.  
If you want to modify the python code, remember to download selenium module at first  
  
by ```pip install selenium```  

I only build the chrome version, so you need to download chromedriver.  
https://chromedriver.chromium.org  
(Feel free to modify the code to use other browser, don't forget to get its driver.)

1. Downloaded the version as the same as your chrome browser.  
2. Unzip file and put the chromedriver exe file with the python in the some directory.  
3. Run the click file and enjoy it.

* Note: The opening window just support for one channcel at a time. If you want to "click" on another channel, please run it again for another channel.
