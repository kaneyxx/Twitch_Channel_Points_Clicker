# Twitch Channel Points Redeem
This is based on Python Selenium module.  
If you want to modify the python code, remember to download selenium module at first  
  
by ```pip install selenium```  

I only build the chrome version, so you need to download chromedriver.  
https://chromedriver.chromium.org  
(Feel free to modify the code to use other browser, don't forget to get its driver.)

1. Download driver as the same version as your chrome browser.  
2. Unzip file and put the chromedriver exe file with the .py file in the same directory.  

***Important!!!***  
Run the file in **OS default terminal** by  
`python Channel_Point_Clicker.py`  
(Due to the mscvrt issues)  

* Note1: You need to enter account/password and pass in the code which sent to your mail or pass the chaptcha thing by yourself. (If anyone need saving account function, just leave you message to let me know.)

* Note2: Make sure your browser driver's version matches to your browser. 

* Note3: The opening window just support for one channcel at a time. If you want to "click" on another channel, please run it again for another channel.

* Note4: Not very sure if the xpath or css is correct for other language twitch interface. Please comment or message me to let me know it, thanks!
